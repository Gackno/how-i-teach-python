# How I teach `Python (3)`

So the other day my gf told me that she would really like to learn some programming. She already learned some basics in math classes at school, but it wasn't really something practical and she wants to learn something which "actually does something". 

I decided to teach her Python as it's basic syntax is pretty simple but you can work your way up to more and more complex uses, until it "actually does something". I plan on documenting the examples and documents I use for those sessions in this repository so they can be reused again, be it by me or by anyone else wanting to learn python.

## Disclaimer

While I do not intend on copying anyones work, some of this course will definitely be inspired by other sources, I'll try to list them here whenever possible.

- For the initial lessons I am going to use codecademy to get some ideas on how to approach this. I highly suggest their site and courses to anyone trying to do self study.
